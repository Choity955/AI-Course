## AI Tools Exploration

This folder contains the AI-generated Video and Presentation Slides created as part of the AI Course project.
The goal was to use AI tools to demonstrate what I learned from both theory (AI concepts) and lab tasks (algorithms & AI games).

There are a multiple AI tool which can use to make video and presentation such as Synthesia, kapwing,InVideo,Pika,Hailuo.These have free trial version and paid version.you can use free trial version.But most of their free version provide a few seconds of video generation.
I have used InVideo to make my AI video creation and Gamma for AI presentation.Both are excellent ,modern AI tools widely used for creative projects.
