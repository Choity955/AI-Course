# ‚≠ê A* Algorithm

## üß† Overview
**A\*** is an **informed search algorithm** that finds the **shortest (optimal) path** from a start node to a goal node.  

It combines:  
- **Actual cost so far:** `g(n)` ‚Äì cost from the start node to the current node `n`  
- **Estimated cost to goal:** `h(n)` ‚Äì heuristic estimate from `n` to the goal  

The total estimated cost is:  

f(n) = g(n) + h(n)


- **f(n):** Total estimated cost through node `n`  
- The algorithm **expands the node with the lowest f(n) first**, efficiently guiding the search toward the goal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How A* Works
### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Initialize**
   - Create an **OPEN list** (priority queue) for nodes to explore.  
   - Create a **CLOSED list** for nodes already explored.  
   - Add the **start node** to OPEN with `f(start) = g(start) + h(start)`.  

2. **Loop**
   - Pick the node `n` from OPEN with the **lowest f(n)**.  
   - If `n` is the **goal**, stop ‚Äî the optimal path is found.  
   - Move `n` to the CLOSED list.  
   - For each neighbor of `n`:
     - Calculate `g(neighbor) = g(n) + cost(n, neighbor)`  
     - Calculate `h(neighbor)` (heuristic estimate to goal)  
     - Calculate `f(neighbor) = g(neighbor) + h(neighbor)`  
     - If the neighbor is in OPEN or CLOSED **with a lower f value**, skip it.  
     - Otherwise, **add or update** it in the OPEN list.  

3. **Repeat** until:
   - The **goal is found**, or  
   - OPEN list is empty (no path exists).

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis
| Type | Complexity | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Time Complexity** | `O(b^d)` | **b** = branching factor, **d** = depth of the solution |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(b^d)` | Stores all generated nodes in memory |

## üßÆ Key Features
- **Traversal Type:** Heuristic-guided graph search  
- **Data Structure Used:** Priority Queue (OPEN list)  
- **Completeness:** ‚úÖ Yes (if branching factor is finite and h(n) is admissible)  
- **Optimality:** ‚úÖ Yes (for **admissible and consistent heuristics**)  
- **Efficiency:** ‚ö° Expands fewer nodes than BFS by using a heuristic
