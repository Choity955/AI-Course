# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Algorithms

This folder contains implementations and explanations of **classic AI search and game algorithms**, commonly used in problem-solving, pathfinding, and two-player games. The algorithms included are:

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **DLS (Depth-Limited Search)**
- **IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)**
- **Bidirectional Search**
- **Best-First Search**
- **Beam Search**
- **A\* Algorithm**
- **Minimax Algorithm**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
